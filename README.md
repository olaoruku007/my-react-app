My React app is a basic single-page application (SPA) with the following features:

Features:
1. Navigation Bar

   - Contains links to three pages: Home, About, and Counter.

2. Three Pages:

   - Home Page (/) → Displays "Welcome to My React App".
   - About Page (/about) → Displays "This is the About Page".
   - Counter Page (/counter) → Includes a counter with an "Increment" button.

3. Counter Functionality

   - The Counter page has a button that, when clicked, increases the counter value.

4. React Router for Navigation

Go to the project directory
  - cd my-react-app

Install the packages.

   - npm install or npm i

Start the Sever.
   - npm start

How It Works
 - When you open the app in the browser (http://localhost:3005 or the correct port), the   
   Home page is displayed.

 - Clicking "About" navigates to /about, and clicking "Counter" navigates to /counter.

 - On the Counter page, clicking the Increment button increases the counter value.
